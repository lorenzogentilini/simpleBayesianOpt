# Simple Bayesian Optimisation
This repository contains a python script implementing a simple Bayesian optimisation
procedure aiming to find the maximum of an unknown function. In particular, we propose
two diffrent surrogate functions: (q) Quadratic function (m) Mexican Hat function.
In both cases the parameters of the function are generated randomly.
As acquisition function, the Upper Confidence Bound (UPB) has been used.
